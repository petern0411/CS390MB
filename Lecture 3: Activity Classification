	How do we detect activities?

- Should be simple to add an activity for the dectection 

	What do we want?
- Want to represent the characteristics of the signal such that different
activities can be cleanly separated. 


Step 1: Collect laeled data
Step 2: Pre-process data
	- remove noise from data
Step 3: Segement the data
	- Classify windows of data

Why do we operate over windows?
	- Many sensor signals vary over time, so you want to capture variabtions by
	operating on windows. 
	- 
Step 4: Extract features for each window


		Feature Extraction from Accelerometer Data:
		- Time Domain:
			- Statiscial Functions:
				- Mean Median
				- Variance, Std Deviation
				- Min, Max, Range
			- Other Functions:
				- Sample differences
				- Zero-Crossing
				- SMA
				- SMV,DSMV
		- Frequency Domain:
			- Wavlet transformations:
				- Coefficients Sum
			- Fourier Transformation:
				- AC-,DC-component 
				- Spectral Coefficients
				- Energy 
				- Entropy
				- FFT Peak
		- Discrete Domain:
			- Symbolic String
				- Euclidean Dist.
				- Levenshtem Edit Dist.
				- DTW, DDTW,
				- Mean dist.

	Frequency Doman features
- Find peaks with some minmum separation and minumom prominence

	Zero Crossings as a feature
- 


	Similarity as a feature

- look at new activity and use a database to compare similarity with the new activity 

	DTW: Dyanamic Time Warping
- takes two signals and scale or stretch them to 

- Use DTW distance as feature for hand gesture recognition
